# Alphanumate — Developer Overview

A calm, focused workspace for everyday text and URL tasks. Fast and privacy‑first: tools run client‑side where possible, so input stays on your device. We group related utilities into suites (e.g., Case Converter, Line Tools, JSON, URL) to reduce context switching and keep you in flow. Predictable UI, strong Core Web Vitals, no clutter.
